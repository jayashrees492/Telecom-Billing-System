A telecom billing system is a software application used by telecommunications companies to track customer usage of services (like calls, messages, and data), calculate charges, and generate bills. It ensures that customers are accurately billed for the services they use, manages payments, and can also handle customer account management, disputes, and reporting. Essentially, itâ€™s the system that keeps track of what you owe for your phone or internet services and helps the company manage that process efficiently.
