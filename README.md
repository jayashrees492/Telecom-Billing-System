The Telecom Billing System project is a simple software application designed to manage customer information and billing for a telecom company. It allows adding new customers with their name and phone number, and assigns them a unique ID. The system can display detailed information about any customer by entering their ID. Users can add funds to a customer's balance or deduct funds from it, ensuring that deductions do not exceed the available balance. It also provides a feature to display the information of all customers in the system. The project is implemented in C, using basic data structures like arrays and structures. It features a menu-driven interface that is easy to use and navigate. The system does not yet include persistent storage, so customer data is not saved between sessions. Error handling is included to manage invalid inputs. This project is a foundational tool for managing telecom billing operations and can be expanded with more features in the future.
